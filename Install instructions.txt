To install FlappyBird on your device please make sure you have pocketcode installed first 
After you have Pocketcode installed go to my programs press the 3dots in the corner 
click that and select import project 
the file you just downloaded from the website should be in your main Downloads folder
find that folder then select FlappyBird.catrobat to import the game into Pocketcode 
have fun : )
